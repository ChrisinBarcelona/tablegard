## Notes for Editing

When you take a photo, please take note of the name of the fabric range, it's colour and asign the photo in the following order. 

1. fabric name
2. fabric colour
3. shot number

for example: 

1. cartrim-smoke-1.jpg
2. cartrim-smoke-2.jpg
3. cartrim-black-1.jpg
4. cartrim-black-2.jpg

*In this instance the, fabric name = cartrim. The fabric colour = smoke and the shot number = starting with 1 Please use lowercase letters only. Follow this model for our file management.*

Kindly, I request the file sizes to be compressed to <400kbs around 350 x 350 px with a medium - low resolution. 

Many Thanks, 
Chris Kelly

## Two photos per fabric

The first photo should be flat, shot from above. It is important to adjust your lighting to match each photo to its pair. Fabric texture is a challenge and some if not done correctly, you will end up wasting time in editing. Adjust your ISO and aperture to best suit the conditions of both the fabric and the lighting where needed.

The scond shot should be at an angle with a crease. Please fold the fabric over ensuring continutity and uniformity as you transition from fabric to fabric. The angle of all creases should be from - top left - bottom right - with a rotation of approx 28Â° Clockwise.
