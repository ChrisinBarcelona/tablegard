## Notes for Editing

When you take a photo, please take note of the name of the fabric range, it's colour and asign the photo in the following order. 

1. fabric name
2. fabric colour
3. shot number

for example: 

1. cartrim-smoke-1.jpg
2. cartrim-smoke-2.jpg

*In this instance the, fabric name = cartrim. The fabric colour = smoke and the shot number = starting with 1 Please use lowercase letters only. Follow this model for our file management.*

Kindly, I request the file sizes to be compressed to <400kbs around 350 x 350 px with a medium - low resolution.
